# Flask RSS Merger

This project is a **Flask-based Python web application** that takes a list of URLs, fetches their individual RSS feeds, and merges them into one unified RSS feed.

## Features
- Accepts a list of URLs.
- Fetches RSS feed from each URL.
- Merges all the feeds into one combined feed.
- Returns the merged RSS feed in a standard XML format.

## Technologies Used
- **Flask**: A lightweight web framework for building the web server.
- **Requests**: To fetch data from URLs.
- **Feedparser**: To parse RSS feeds from the URLs.
- **Werkzeug**: Provides utilities for handling secure file uploads.

  - On macOS/Linux:
    ```bash
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```

#### 3. Install Dependencies
Install the required packages listed in the `requirements.txt` file:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### 4. Running the Application

## API Usage

### Request
Send a POST request to the `/merge_feed` endpoint with a JSON body containing a list of URLs:

**Example Request (using `curl`):**

```bash

<rss version="2.0">
  <channel>
    <title>Combined RSS Feed</title>
    <link>http://www.example.com/</link>
    <description>Combined feed from multiple sources.</description>
